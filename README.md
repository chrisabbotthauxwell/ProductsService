# Products Service

A basic product management HTTP microservice for managing stock levels and stock availability for a catalogue of Products. Operates alongside a complimentary order management HTTP microservice to provide an Order fulfilment and Products management system.

The microservice uses an in-memory product catalogue, no product data persistence is implemented.

The microservices are integrated by a pub/sub flow with Dapr.

# Service endpoints
## Get product by id
`GET /Products/{id}`

Returns the requested Product object as JSON.

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "inStock": false,
  "stockCount": 0
}
```

## Get all products
`GET /Products/`

Returns a list of product objects as JSON.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "string",
    "name": "string",
    "inStock": false,
    "stockCount": 0
  },
  {
    "id": "string",
    "name": "string",
    "inStock": false,
    "stockCount": 0
  }
]
```

## Update product stock
`PUT /Products/{id}/stock`

```json
{
  "stockCount": 0
}
```

Updates the stock level for the given Product.

# Event-driven integrations
The Products Service integrates with event topics using a pub/sub flow with a Dapr sidecar:

| Topic | Publish/Subscribe | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `stock-available` | Publish | Publish information about Product stock levels when a product is restocked |
| `order-placed` | Subscribe | Read information about a newly placed order |
| `order-fulfilled` | Publish | Publish that an order can be fulfilled based on order details and available stock |
| `order-backordered` | Publish | Publish that an order cannot be fulfilled and is backordered based on order details and available stock |

## Stock available
If a product's stock level is above 0 then the product is `inStock` and any pending orders can be filled.

A Warehosue Manager can update the stock level for a given product. If a product's stock level is updated and it is now `inStock`, the Products Service will emit a `stock-available` event.

```json
{
  "productId": "p001",
  "stockCount": 10,
}
```

Services subscribing to the `stock-available` topic can act on that event accordingly.

## Order placed
When a Customer places an order through an external system, an event is published to the `order-placed` topic.

```json
{
  "orderId": "abc123",
  "productId": "p001",
  "quantity": 1
}
```

Orders can be placed only for one type of product at a time. One or more items of that product can be ordered in a single transaction.

The Products Service subscribes to the `order placed` topic and decreases the `StockCount` for a product when a new order is placed.

A User can place an order for a product, even if the product is out of stock. The Products Service will listen to the `order-placed` topic and reduce the stock count for the product accordingly.

## Order fulfilled
When the Products Service is processing a new order, if there is enough stock to fulfil that order then an event is published to the `order-fulfilled` topic to indicate that the order has been fulfilled and stock levels have been adjusted.

```json
{
  "orderId": "abc123",
  "fulfilled": true,
  "productId": "p001"
}
```

Services subscribing to the `order-fulfilled` topic can act on that event accordingly.

## Order backordered
When the Products Service is processing a new order, if there is not enough stock to fulfil that order then an event is published to the `order-backordered` topic.

```json
{
  "orderId": "abc123",
  "fulfilled": false,
  "productId": "p001"
}
```

Services subscribing to the `order-backordered` topic can act on that event accordingly.

# Local development
## Dapr CLI
### Install
Install the Dapr CLI from Powershell
```
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dapr/cli/master/install/install.ps1 | iex
```
or from the command prompt
```
winget install Dapr.CLI
```
### Verify
After Dapr CLI is installed, verify the installation with `dapr --version`. It should return:
```
CLI version: 1.15.1
Runtime version: n/a
```
### Initialise
Initalise Dapr to set up the Dapr CLI runtime
```
dapr init
```
This will create and start 4 Docker containers:
- dapr_redis
- dapr_zipkin
- dapr_scheduler
- dapr_placement

## Run and Debug
### Local ProductsService
