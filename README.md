# Products and Orders Management
An exercise to create two microservices for managing Orders and Product inventory.
- Communication between microservices will take place via a common Dapr pubsub component
- The microservices will be containerised using Docker
- The microservices will run locally in a Docker Compose stack and will communicate using Dapr pubsub backed by Redis Streams
- The microservices will be deployed to Azure Container Apps (ACA) and will communicate using Dapr pubsub backed by Azure Service Bus

## Event-driven integrations
The Products Service integrates with event topics using a pub/sub flow with a Dapr sidecar:

| Topic | Products service | Order service | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| `stock-available` | Publish | Subscribe | Publish information about Product stock levels when a product is restocked. Subscribe to know when pending orders can be fulfilled. |
| `stock-updated` | Subscribe | Publish | Publish information about stock being used to fulfil an order. Subscribe to manage stock levels |
| `order-placed` | Subscribe | Publish | Publish information about newly placed orders. Subscribe |
| `order-fulfilled` | Publish | Subscribe | Publish that an order can be fulfilled based on order details and available stock |
| `order-backordered` | Publish | Subscribe | Publish that an order cannot be fulfilled and is backordered based on order details and available stock |

### Stock available
If a product's stock level is above 0 then the product is `inStock` and any pending orders can be filled.

A Warehosue Manager can update the stock level for a given product using the Products Service. If a product's stock level is updated and it is now `inStock`, the Products Service will emit a `stock-available` event.

```json
{
  "productId": "p001",
  "stockCount": 10,
}
```

The Orders Service subscribes to the `stock-available` topic and will update any `pending` orders if there is now enough available stock to fulfil them.

### Order placed
When a Customer places an order through the Orders Service, an event is published to the `order-placed` topic.

```json
{
  "orderId": "o001",
  "productId": "p001",
  "quantity": 1
}
```

Orders can be placed only for one type of product at a time. One or more items of that product can be ordered in a single transaction.

The Products Service subscribes to the `order-placed` topic and decreases the `StockCount` for a product when a new order is placed.

A User can place an order for a product, even if the product is out of stock. The Products Service will listen to the `order-placed` topic and reduce the stock count for the product accordingly.

### Order fulfilled
When the Products Service is processing a new order, if there is enough stock to fulfil that order then an event is published to the `order-fulfilled` topic to indicate that the order has been fulfilled and stock levels have been adjusted.

```json
{
  "orderId": "o001",
  "fulfilled": true,
  "productId": "p001"
}
```

The Orders Service subscribes to the `order-fulfilled` topic and will update the corresponding orders accordingly.

### Order backordered
When the Products Service is processing a new order, if there is not enough stock to fulfil that order then an event is published to the `order-backordered` topic.

```json
{
  "orderId": "o001",
  "fulfilled": false,
  "productId": "p001"
}
```

The Orders Service subscribes to the `order-fulfilled` topic and will update the corresponding orders accordingly.

## Products Service

A basic product management HTTP microservice for managing stock levels and stock availability for a catalogue of Products. Operates alongside a complimentary order management HTTP microservice to provide an Order fulfilment and Products management system.

The microservice uses an in-memory product catalogue, no product data persistence is implemented.

The microservices are integrated by a pub/sub flow with Dapr.

### Service endpoints
#### Get product by id
`GET /Products/{id}`

Returns the requested Product object as JSON.

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "inStock": false,
  "stockCount": 0
}
```

#### Get all products
`GET /Products/`

Returns a list of product objects as JSON.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "string",
    "name": "string",
    "inStock": false,
    "stockCount": 0
  },
  {
    "id": "string",
    "name": "string",
    "inStock": false,
    "stockCount": 0
  }
]
```

#### Update product stock
`PUT /Products/{id}/stock`

```json
{
  "stockCount": 0
}
```
Updates the stock level for the given Product.

## Orders Service

A basic order management HTTP microservice for managing customer orders for products. Operates alongside a complimentary product management HTTP microservice to provide an Order fulfilment and Products management system.

A customer can place an order for only one product type at a time, but they can place an order for as many of those items as they like.

The microservice uses an in-memory list of orders, no order data persistence is implemented.

The microservices are integrated by a pub/sub flow with Dapr.

### Order status
A customer order can be in one of three states:
|Order status|Description|
|--|--|
|`placed`|The order has been placed and is being processed by the system|
|`fulfilled`|Stock is available to fulfil the order|
|`pending`|Stock is not available to fulfil the order, the order is pending stock availability before fulfilment|

### Service endpoints
#### Get Order by id
`GET /Orders/{id}/`
Returns the requested Order object as JSON.
```json
{
  "orderId": "o001",
  "productId": "p002",
  "quantity": 1,
  "status": "placed",
  "createdAt": "2025-07-18T10:21:74Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-07-18T12:34:56Z"
}
```

#### Get Orders
`GET /Orders/`
Returns all Order objects as JSON
```json
[
  {
  "orderId": "o001",
  "productId": "p002",
  "quantity": 1,
  "status": "placed",
  "createdAt": "2025-07-18T10:21:74Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-07-18T12:34:56Z"
  },
  {
  "orderId": "o002",
  "productId": "p001",
  "quantity": 15,
  "status": "pending",
  "createdAt": "2025-07-18T10:39:10Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-07-18T10:39:17Z"
  },
  {
  "orderId": "o002",
  "productId": "p001",
  "quantity": 6,
  "status": "fulfilled",
  "createdAt": "2025-07-02T22:14:22Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-07-03T08:54:68Z"
  }
]
```

#### Place Order
`POST /Orders/`
```json
{
  "productid": "p001",
  "quantity": 15
}
```
Creates a new order detailing the ordered product and the quanitity ordered.

## Logging
Dual-mode logging strategy for local debugging and deployment to Azure Container Apps, using `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`.

- Environment-based switching, driven by `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` value.
- All logs are structured as JSON for easy querying and analysis, using the ConsoleFormatter feature.
- Log level is configurable by environment variable for both local and cloud.
- Simple logging implemented. More complex logging could be implemented using [Serilog](https://serilog.net/)

### Logging for local development

- Console sink only.
- Debug level logging for visibility of all levels of log output.
- Fast, visible, and file-persistent logs with no cloud dependency.

### Logging for Azure deployments
- Console sink only.
- Information level logging.
- Centralized, queryable logs with correlation across services using Dapr Observability, Application Insights, and Azure Monitor for both logs and distributed tracing.
- Dapr sidecars in ACA automatically export logs, metrics, and traces to Azure Monitor/App Insights.
- For distributed tracing, logs should correlation IDs or trace context. This is supported by default when using Dapr and App Insights. No extra code is needed, console output must be JSON.

# Code changes
Trunk based development -> Commit changes to `main` and push to origin

# Build container image
```
docker build --no-cache -t productsservice:latest .
```

# Deploy infrastrcture and app to Azure
Build and deployment is handled using `Powershell` scripts in the `/devops/` folder which are run from the commandline in the solution root.

Three scripts are prepared:
## 1. Deployment variables
`.\devops\variables.ps1` defines deployment variables for the deployment.

Increment the `$ATTEMPT_NO` value to reflect the deployment version.

## 2. Deploy infrastrcture
From the solution root folder in a Powershell terminal, run:
```bash
.\devops\infrastrcuture.ps1
```
This will create the required Azure services ready for app deployment.

## Build app image and deploy to ACA
From the solution root folder in a Powershell terminal, run:
```
.\devops\deploy-app.ps1
```
This will create or update a Azure Container App.

# Future CI/CD
- Use Github PR process for merges to origin
    - Automate PRs using GenAI code review agent
