# Products and Orders Management
An exercise to create two microservices for managing Orders and Product inventory.
- Communication between microservices will take place via a common Dapr pubsub component
- The microservices will be containerised using Docker
- The microservices will run locally in a Docker Compose stack and will communicate using Dapr pubsub backed by Redis Streams
- The microservices will be deployed to Azure Container Apps (ACA) and will communicate using Dapr pubsub backed by Azure Service Bus

## Event-driven integrations
The Products Service integrates with event topics using a pub/sub flow with a Dapr sidecar:

| Topic | Products service | Order service | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| `stock-available` | Publish | Subscribe | Publish information about Product stock levels when a product is restocked |
| `order-placed` | Subscribe | Publish | Publish information about newly placed orders |
| `order-fulfilled` | Publish | Subscribe | Publish that an order can be fulfilled based on order details and available stock |
| `order-backordered` | Publish | Subscribe | Publish that an order cannot be fulfilled and is backordered based on order details and available stock |

### Stock available
If a product's stock level is above 0 then the product is `inStock` and any pending orders can be filled.

A Warehosue Manager can update the stock level for a given product using the Products Service. If a product's stock level is updated and it is now `inStock`, the Products Service will emit a `stock-available` event.

```json
{
  "productId": "p001",
  "stockCount": 10,
}
```

The Orders Service subscribes to the `stock-available` topic and will update any `pending` orders if there is now enough available stock to fulfil them.

### Order placed
When a Customer places an order through the Orders Service, an event is published to the `order-placed` topic.

```json
{
  "orderId": "o001",
  "productId": "p001",
  "quantity": 1
}
```

Orders can be placed only for one type of product at a time. One or more items of that product can be ordered in a single transaction.

The Products Service subscribes to the `order-placed` topic and decreases the `StockCount` for a product when a new order is placed.

A User can place an order for a product, even if the product is out of stock. The Products Service will listen to the `order-placed` topic and reduce the stock count for the product accordingly.

### Order fulfilled
When the Products Service is processing a new order, if there is enough stock to fulfil that order then an event is published to the `order-fulfilled` topic to indicate that the order has been fulfilled and stock levels have been adjusted.

```json
{
  "orderId": "o001",
  "fulfilled": true,
  "productId": "p001"
}
```

The Orders Service subscribes to the `order-fulfilled` topic and will update the corresponding orders accordingly.

### Order backordered
When the Products Service is processing a new order, if there is not enough stock to fulfil that order then an event is published to the `order-backordered` topic.

```json
{
  "orderId": "o001",
  "fulfilled": false,
  "productId": "p001"
}
```

The Orders Service subscribes to the `order-fulfilled` topic and will update the corresponding orders accordingly.

## Products Service

A basic product management HTTP microservice for managing stock levels and stock availability for a catalogue of Products. Operates alongside a complimentary order management HTTP microservice to provide an Order fulfilment and Products management system.

The microservice uses an in-memory product catalogue, no product data persistence is implemented.

The microservices are integrated by a pub/sub flow with Dapr.

### Service endpoints
#### Get product by id
`GET /Products/{id}`

Returns the requested Product object as JSON.

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "inStock": false,
  "stockCount": 0
}
```

#### Get all products
`GET /Products/`

Returns a list of product objects as JSON.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "string",
    "name": "string",
    "inStock": false,
    "stockCount": 0
  },
  {
    "id": "string",
    "name": "string",
    "inStock": false,
    "stockCount": 0
  }
]
```

#### Update product stock
`PUT /Products/{id}/stock`

```json
{
  "stockCount": 0
}
```
Updates the stock level for the given Product.

## Orders Service

A basic order management HTTP microservice for managing customer orders for products. Operates alongside a complimentary product management HTTP microservice to provide an Order fulfilment and Products management system.

A customer can place an order for only one product type at a time, but they can place an order for as many of those items as they like.

The microservice uses an in-memory list of orders, no order data persistence is implemented.

The microservices are integrated by a pub/sub flow with Dapr.

### Order status
A customer order can be in one of three states:
|Order status|Description|
|--|--|
|`placed`|The order has been placed and is being processed by the system|
|`fulfilled`|Stock is available to fulfil the order|
|`pending`|Stock is not available to fulfil the order, the order is pending stock availability before fulfilment|

### Service endpoints
#### Get Order by id
`GET /Orders/{id}/`
Returns the requested Order object as JSON.
```json
{
  "orderId": "o001",
  "productId": "p002",
  "quantity": 1,
  "status": "placed",
  "createdAt": "2025-07-18T10:21:74Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-07-18T12:34:56Z"
}
```

#### Get Orders
`GET /Orders/`
Returns all Order objects as JSON
```json
[
  {
  "orderId": "o001",
  "productId": "p002",
  "quantity": 1,
  "status": "placed",
  "createdAt": "2025-07-18T10:21:74Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-07-18T12:34:56Z"
  },
  {
  "orderId": "o002",
  "productId": "p001",
  "quantity": 15,
  "status": "pending",
  "createdAt": "2025-07-18T10:39:10Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-07-18T10:39:17Z"
  },
  {
  "orderId": "o002",
  "productId": "p001",
  "quantity": 6,
  "status": "fulfilled",
  "createdAt": "2025-07-02T22:14:22Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-07-03T08:54:68Z"
  }
]
```

#### Place Order
`POST /Orders/`
```json
{
  "productid": "p001",
  "quantity": 15
}
```
Creates a new order detailing the ordered product and the quanitity ordered.

# Code changes
Trunk based development -> Commit changes to `main` and push to origin

# Build container image
```
docker build --no-cache -t productsservice:latest .
```

# Deploy infrastrcture and app to Azure
Build and deployment is handled using `Powershell` scripts in the `/devops/` folder which are run from the commandline in the solution root.

Three scripts are prepared:
## 1. Deployment variables
`.\devops\variables.ps1` defines deployment variables for the deployment.

Increment the `$ATTEMPT_NO` value to reflect the deployment version.

## 2. Deploy infrastrcture
From the solution root folder in a Powershell terminal, run:
```bash
.\devops\infrastrcuture.ps1
```
This will create the required Azure services ready for app deployment.

## Build app image and deploy to ACA
From the solution root folder in a Powershell terminal, run:
```
.\devops\deploy-app.ps1
```
This will create or update a Azure Container App.

# Future CI/CD
- Use Github PR process for merges to origin
    - Automate PRs using GenAI code review agent
    - Automate code quality checks
    - Human in the loop to approve PR before merge
- On merge to `main`
    - Automate creation new Docker image and push to ACR
    - Automate creation of new revision microservice and deploy new image
